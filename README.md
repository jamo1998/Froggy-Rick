# Froggy-Rick

Rick and Morty are back at it with their adventures! Rick and Morty have
seperated while inside the Citadel of Ricks and must find their ways back
to each other. Can you help them?!

## About the Game

This is going to be a 2D crawler a lot like the game Frogger! The player will
have the option to start as Rick or Morty, once the player chooses a character
they will start off in the safe zone. Depending on the character you choose,
Rick or Morty will be waiting in a random spot accross the street. The goal is
to make it accross while avoiding all the incoming danger along the way.
